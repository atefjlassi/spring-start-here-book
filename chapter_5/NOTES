Singleton beans in real-world scenarios:
(page 107) IMPORTANT:

Thus far we’ve discussed how Spring manages singleton beans. It’s time to also discuss
things you need to be aware of when working with singleton beans. Let’s start by considering
some scenarios where you should or shouldn’t use singleton beans.
Because the singleton bean scope assumes that multiple components of the app
can share an object instance, the most important thing to consider is that these beans
must be immutable. Most often, a real-world app executes actions on multiple threads
(e.g., any web app). In such a scenario, multiple threads share the same object
instance. If these threads change the instance, you encounter a race-condition scenario
